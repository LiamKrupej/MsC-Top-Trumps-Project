Persistent Game Data
Upon completion of the game, the user should automatically write the following information about the game play to
a database:

// THIS IS FIRST TABLE

• How many draws were there?
• Who won the game?
• How many rounds were played in the game?
• How many rounds did each player win?

You should select one team member’s database on the yacata server, from the Database Theory and Applications
course, to write to. It is important you do not remove the username and password from the final code, as this allows
us to test the software. You should also provide details of this database (username, database name and password) in
the report.

There should also be possible, so long as a game isn't currently in progress, for the user to connect to the database
and get information about previous games. This should include the following:

// THIS IS DERIVED FROM THE FIRST TABLE - DO LATER

• Number of games played overall
• How many times the computer has won
• How many times the human has won
• The average number of draws
• The largest number of rounds played in a single game

These should be calculated using SQL
